##### CrabSO was created in mind to give Division B (middle school) students another invitational to compete at before their regionals and/or state competitions as well as provide Marylanders another in-state competition.

CrabSO is part of Chesapeake Stem Connections, a 501(c)(3) registered Maryland based nonprofit dedicated to supporting up and coming middle school Science Olympiad teams in Maryland. All proceeds from CrabSO are being processed by Chesapeake Stem Connections and will be reinvested back into Chesapeake Stem Connections endeavors such as financially supporting Maryland teams, providing workshops, and funding future in-person competitions.
